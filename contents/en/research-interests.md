My research interests center on **computer vision** and **LLM inference acceleration**, including:

- **LLM inference acceleration**: Efficient inference and deployment for large language models, e.g., model compression, quantization, pruning, and inference engine optimization to improve speed and scalability under resource constraints.
- **Computer vision**: Representation learning for images and video, object detection and recognition, multimodal understanding, and applications combined with language models.
- **Vision and language**: Integrating visual representations with language models for image-text understanding, visual QA, and multimodal reasoning.
