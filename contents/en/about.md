Hi, I'm **Sun Yaqi**. I'm an undergraduate student in Software Engineering (Intelligent Software) at the School of Intelligent Software and Engineering, Nanjing University. My research interests focus on **computer vision** and **LLM inference acceleration**.

I'm particularly interested in:

- Efficient inference and deployment for large language models, including model compression, quantization, and acceleration.
- Representation learning and downstream tasks in computer vision (e.g., object detection, image understanding).
- Combining vision and language models for multimodal understanding and reasoning.

I'm open to research internships and collaborations. Feel free to reach out via email.
